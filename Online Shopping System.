This project is an **Online Shopping System** that allows users to buy products online easily and safely. Customers can browse products, place orders, make payments, and track deliveries. Sellers and admins can manage products, orders, and users through dashboards. The system focuses on simplicity, security, and good user experience.

## Project Structure

The system is divided into three main parts:
